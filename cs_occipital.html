      <h2 class="txt-h2">Who was this for?</h2>
      <p>
        Occipital is a spatial computing company based out of San Francisco, CA. They pioneered the first 3D sensor for mobile devices, the Structure sensor, to bring 3D scanning, large-scale reconstruction and augemented reality capabilities to phones and tablets.
      </p>

  <h2 class="txt-h2">What problem did you solve?</h2>
  <p>
    Which potential user group would garner the most value from using the structure sensor and Occipital's platform? My team (<a href="http://sarahannehudson.com" target="top">Sarah Anne Hudson</a>, <a href="http://www.sylvia-kim.com" target="top">Sylvia Kim</a> and Oriane Dailey) sought to unlock the answer to this question through rigorous and thorough research that engendered empathy.

  <strong>In a nutshell:</strong>

    Interview Users &#8680; Discuss &#8680; Whiteboard &#8680; Repeat

  </div><!-- /slug article__summary -->

  <p>
    The plan of attack was to catalog potential touch points across the platform and identify potential user's pain points. Our research had given us a broad view of industries that may benefit from 3D technology. However, my team recognized that this was a distant and impersonal view without feedback from real users and stakeholders. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Staring at a computer screen only gets you so far - I couldn't proceed until I talked to people about the solutions they needed. 
  </p>
  <h3 class="txt-h3">So, what did you actually do?</h3>
  <p>
    My team interviewed doctors, medical students, several developers, a biomedical engineer, a scenic carpenter, a construction foreman and an assistant director. We even went to bridal boutiques and spoke with dressmakers. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, armed with insight into the day-to-day lives of potential users, my team began to assemble user's need-states and map them to Occipital's value proposition.  
  </p>
  <p>
    I miscalculated my next steps. Since my team and I had been ideating and diverging for almost two weeks, I thought the next step <em>should be</em> to converge. It turns out, what you think your next steps <strong>should be</strong> and what your next steps actually <strong>need to be</strong> aren't always congruent. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We had a breakthrough when we recognized the need to diverge further and to trust the process.

  <h2 class="txt-h2">How did you decide on a recommendation?</h2>
  <p>
    After mind-mapping potential use cases from the most promising industries, my team identified patterns in both user need-states as well as the most prominent hooks to Occipital's platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    We noticed that people in certain industries were taking thousands of photographs in attempts to understand spatial relationships.
  <p>
    When my team finally converged, we had an ideal candidate in mind for Occipital's product, a key
    set of features that candidate would be interested in, and an action plan to both engage that group
    and illicit feedback from them at regular intervals
  </p>
  <h2 class="txt-h2">How did it end up?</h2>
  <p>
    Our final recommendation was that Occipital focus on the film industry and position their product as a communication tool.
  </p>
  <ul class="tag-line">
   <li>Send twenty or thirty units to industry leaders</li>
   <li>With permission, collect usage data from units</li>
   <li>Enable feedback options tied to specific tasks</li>
   <li>Quantify how many photographs a user has to take to do their jobs</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Why count the number of photographs?</h3>
   <p>
    One person we interviewed said they had taken over <strong>ten thousand</strong> photographs while tracking
    the extras during the filming of their last movie. If, with their new sensor, they only have to take, say, three
    thousand photos, you could infer the 3D scanning technology "soaked up" seven thousand images. 
  </p>
  <h3>Why the film industry?</h3>
  <p>
    This vertical involves multidisciplinary groups that collaborate toward a common goal over an
    extended period of time. This is in contrast to other verticals, such as the wedding industry, 
    in which separate contenders collaborate during a short time line, yet compete financially for funding 
    out of the same budget.
  </p>
  <p>
    The film industry possessed attractive features:
  </p>
  <ul class="tag-line">
   <li>Low financial and regulatory risk</li>
   <li>High technology adoption rate</li>
   <li>High social media presence</li>
   <li>Multi-faceted user roles</li>
 </ul>

  <h2 class="txt-h2">What     are the takeaways?</h2>
  <h3 class="tag-line txt-h3">Researching</h3>
  <p>
    Research includes acknowledging when something is <em>not</em> a good idea. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, the team discovered a potential use case for shoppers to scan their feet and use the generated model to purchase the perfect pair of shoes. 
  </p>
    <strong>Let's think about this.</strong> People use the product just once, get their perfect pair of shoes, then probably don't need the product ever again?
  </p>
  <p>
    Other examples are industries such as healthcare that represent a higher level of risk to adopt new technology due to regulatory and security concerns surrounding storing and transmitting patient data.  
  </p>
  <h3 class="tag-line txt-h3">Interviewing</h3>
  <p>
    Managing your assumptions is a key component of interviewing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't ask about technological features - ask about human behavior.
  </p>
  <h3 class="tag-line txt-h3">Presenting</h3>
  <p>
    Don't wait until the last second to check if you are on the right Wi-Fi to connect to Apple TV!
  </p>
  <p>
    It's almost <em>guaranteed</em> you'll be on the wrong one, even if you've deleted the other networks a dozen times.
