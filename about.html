      <h2 class="txt-h2">What's my Deal?</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a platform, framework and code-agnostic programmer. Because of this, I have a unique perspective on 
        compatability and portability.

  <h2 class="txt-h2">What's my Background?</h2>
  <p>
    I started coding in the eighth grade, before <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> was a thing. 
  </p>
  <p>
    When I was 17, I worked at Boston University's Engineering Information Technology department and 
    became familiar with Bash shell scripting and networking. In the meanwhile, I learned C++ while
    attending <abbr title="Boston University">BU</abbr>.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Though Microsoft Visual Basic made me want to cry at times, this underpinning in C++ gave me a 
    great foundation in object-oriented code that I've appreciated, to this day. 
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Later, I worked independently as an "emergency programming service", of sorts. If another 
    programming team blew their deadline, they would call me.

  <!-- empty span below for anchor jumping is hacky, look at negative margins, maybe?-->

    This exposure to different programming languages, <abbr title="Content Management Systems">CMSs</abbr>,

  <h2 class="txt-h2">What's <abbr title="Apprentice User Experience">AUX?</abbr></h2>
  <div class="slug article__nutshell">
  <strong>In a nutshell:</strong>
  <span class="h1-spaced">
    Systematic instruction on iterative design, prototyping, wireframing, user interviewing, usability testing,
    and front end development topics such as accessibility, performance budgeting and atomic code architecture 
  </span>
  </div><!-- /slug article__summary -->

  <p>
    Prior to the Apprentice User Experience <abbr title="Apprentice User Experience">(AUX)</abbr> 
    program at <a href="http://freshtilledsoil.com" target="top">Fresh Tilled Soil</a>, I was 
    working as a network engineer and freelance programmer. I wanted to focus on creating digital 
    products in a human way and <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> was a natural choice. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically, I apprenticed as a front end developer to take a deep dive into HTML and CSS architecture. 
    During the program, world-class mentors reinforced the skills to write clean, semantic code and craft 
    consistently awesome user experiences. Later, this all culminated in participating in client work in 
    different industry verticals. 
  </p>
  <h3 class="txt-h3">So, what did I actually do?</h3>
  <p>
    <abbr title="Apprentice User Experience">AUX</abbr> was structured as a complex set of problems and challenges, all
    solved and overcome by immersing oneself in evidence-based research and iterative design processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Highly competitive, entrance to <abbr title="Apprentice User Experience">AUX</abbr> was gated 
    by an initial case study on a previous project, which 
    <!-- [below] this is in a different CDN container-->
    <a href="http://5c9c7a7670ff5ed749b3-40e2f97543bf7fa749a7fe9213856f03.r99.cf2.rackcdn.com/index.html" target="top"> 
      you can see here</a> 
      (it'll open in a new window), filtered by a "bootcamp" design sprint, which
    <a href="cs_langwhich">you can read about here</a>, and converged at a presentation of our 
    sprint to the other applicants and directors of the program. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Four people get in to the program each cycle.

  <h2 class="txt-h2">What's my Process?</h2>
  <!-- dude, where's my h3?-->
  <p>
    Here are a few things I know to work 100% of the time: 
    <!-- should I even keep these if I don't make them individual articles?-->
  </p>
  <h4 class="txt-h4 tag-line">I Talk Before I Code</h4>
  <p>
    I don't rush into coding something that doesn't solve the problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's not agile if it has to be done all over again.
  </p>
</article><!-- /first article about my process-->

<hr /><!-- paragraph-level thematic break-->

<article>
  <h4 class="txt-h4 tag-line">I Focus on People</h4>
  <p>
    I'm different from other developers. I develop for humans.
  </p>
  <p>
    People say, "content is king". Sadly, those people forgot about <em>people</em>.
  </p>
</article><!-- /second article about my process-->

<hr />

<article>
  <h4 class="txt-h4 tag-line">I Code in Whatever</h4>
  <p>
    I do my best to master logic and code theory - everything else is easy
  </p>
  <p>
    I have used both object-oriented and procedural programming languages and continue to
    learn as much as I can about both ends of the spectrum. 
  </p>
  <h2 class="txt-h2">And When You're not Coding?</h2>
  <p>
    I like riding my bike, drawing in pen, gardening and obsessing over stationery. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Really, though, hanging out with my dog trumps all of those things.
