      <h2 class="txt-h2">Who was this for?</h2>
      <p>
        This project was <em>really</em> for all the amazing people from all over the world I have been fortunate enough to work with over the last decade. Some of these people were Serbian or Sudanese refugees who were somehow working two jobs, going to school and sending money back home to their families.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project spanned over the course of 4 months, beginning as an entrance project to <abbr title="Apprenticeship in User Experience">AUX</abbr> and moving through multiple iterations. Finally, it peaked as a fully validated and tested prototype.
      </p>

  <h2 class="txt-h2">What problem did you solve?</h2>
  <p>
    English Language Learners (<abbr title="English Language Learners">ELLs</abbr>) need a better way to learn nursing-specific vocabulary because they face acute challenges in both comprehension and regulation.
  </p> 
  <p>
    This application aims to reduce the amount of tedious repetition faced by <abbr title="English Language Learner">ELL</abbr> nursing students, so they can focus on content - not linguistics.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    There is also more at stake for an <abbr title="English Language Learner">ELL</abbr> nursing student. Cultural stigma, fear of public speaking and struggles with <dfn title="Language's action">metalinguistics</dfn> (what language <em>does</em>, as opposed to what language <em>means</em>) all collude to hamper an <abbr title="English Language Learner">ELL</abbr> student from succeeding.

  <p>
    After interviewing nursing students, their need to leverage both conversational and academic English was clear. How can they begin to master both content-specific vocabulary as well as colloquial courtesies and idioms?
  </p>
  <!-- [FIXME] using a dfn with an id does not jump to the right spot, similar to an anchor -->
  <p>
    Interviewing English as a Second Language (<abbr title="English Language Learners">ESL</abbr>) instructors uncovered the concept of <dfn title="Blending of two languages">codeswitching</dfn> - blending a person's <dfn title="Native language">L1</dfn> (their native language) and <dfn title="Secondary language">L2</dfn> (their newly acquired language, learned later in life) in a coordinated effort to deepen their understanding of the new language.
  </p>
  <p>
    I needed to test my assumption that, if specifically encouraged to blend their primary and secondary languages together, an <abbr title"English Language Learner">ELL</abbr> student will learn more words faster and more comfortably.
  <h3 class="txt-h3">So, what did you actually do?</h3>
  <p>
    Before creating a valuable prototype, I needed to create meaningful personas to reference during decision making. Powerful personas are the synthesized compilation of multiple user interviews and maintain a human face during development.
  </p>
 <h4 class="txt-h4 project--slug">Creating personas</h4>
    <div class="cs__media">
      <img class="project__upfront" src="assets/img/projects/persona_katerina.png" alt="Persona for a nursing student, Katerina" />
    </div><!-- /project__media- -container-->
        <p>
          Personas, such as this one outlining Katerina's journey starting before enrolling in nursing school in the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>, create empathy for potential users as well as uncover previously unexplored touch points and user experience opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, Katerina was a nurse in her home country. She understands medical terminology, but needs to map it to English.

  <h2 class="txt-h2">What were your assumptions?</h2>
  <p>
    One of my primary assumptions was that if I could make it easier for a person to switch between their <dfn title="Native language">L1</dfn> and their <dfn title="Secondary language">L2</dfn>, I would make it easier for them to increase the overlap between their L1 and L2. This, in my mind, was a path to developing fluency.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, a portion of the usability test was crafted in an attempt to find the threshold of the ratio of of a user's <dfn title="Native language">L1</dfn> and <dfn title="Secondary language">L2</dfn> before it became uncomfortable or disorienting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Somehow, I didn't notice an even more dangerous assumption: was I making an app specifically for people to codeswitch? The app was supposed to help people navigate languages. Codeswitching is a tool a user has in their arsenal to accomplish this task - it's not the primary reason for someone to use the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    People are using the app to <em>learn nursing-specific vocabulary</em>. 
  </p>
  <h2 class="txt-h2">What feedback did you get from users?</h2>
  <p>
    Initially, everyone was pretty confused.
  </p>
  <ul class="tag-line">
   <li>Everyone was trying to click <em>everything</em></li>
   <li>People were afraid they were going to be tested</li>
   <li>People wanted control over the codeswitching</li>
   <li>People were very frustrated that the app controlled the codeswitching</li>
   <li>Did I mention that people didn't want the app controlling what they saw or did?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It's quite understandable. Humans don't want an application to dictate what they see and how they interact with content.
  </p>
  <h3>How did you go on, from there?</h3>
   <p>
    I reviewed all of the feedback and tried to find patterns and common responses to my questions. Once I saw similar behaviors exhibited in my users, I could localize how successful certain features were.
  </p>
  <h3>What did you change?</h3>
  <p>
    My users needed more control. Or, less needed to change. Basically, too much was happening, at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    To different degrees, the application would swap out text in English with text in Spanish. The app included academic text specific to the medical field.
  <p>
    So, moving forward:
  </p>
  <ul class="tag-line">
   <li>Simplify everything</li>
   <li>Give users nearly complete control</li>
   <li>Allow users to save and compare terms</li>
   <li>Adjust app based on location it will be used in - studying on the train? In class? During clinical rotations?</li>
 </ul>

  <h2 class="txt-h2">What are the takeaways?</h2>
  <h3 class="tag-line txt-h3">Usability Testing</h3>
  <p>
    Usability testing also includes determining who is an outlier.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't lead users during a test. It's painful, but watching them struggle makes you build a better application.
  </p>
  <h3 class="tag-line txt-h3">Experience Design</h3>
  <p>
    Think about where the user is supposed to use your website or application. Not to optimize their bandwidth usage, but to figure out what content they need in which situation.
  </p>
  <p>
    While you're at it, do think of their location in relation to their bandwidth. Is it possible you may need to optimize the experience, and possibly the asset management, for a Wi-Fi connection?
  </p>
  <p>
    How many hands can they devote to using your app?
  </p>
  <h3 class="tag-line txt-h3">Gotchas</h3>
  <p>
    I was really looking forward to trying to develop a first flight of this application using the Google Translate API.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, you have to pay for access to the translation API! 
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, parsing random lines using javascript is pretty painful. PHP is better at it.
