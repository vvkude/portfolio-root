      <h2 class="txt-h2">Who was This For?</h2>
      <p>
        Occipital is a spatial computing company based out of San Francisco, CA. They pioneered the first 3D sensor for mobile devices, the Structure sensor, to bring 3D scanning, large-scale reconstruction and augemented reality capabilities to phones and tablets. This brings potentially unprecedented power and ease-of-use to a wide swath of industry verticals.

  <h2 class="txt-h2">What's Problem did you Solve?</h2>
  <p>
    Which potential user group would garner the <em>most</em> value from using the structure sensor and Occipital's platform? My team (<a href="http://sarahannehudson.com">Sarah Anne Hudson</a>, Sylvia Kim and Oriane Dailey) was charged with the task of unlocking the answer to this question through rigorous and thorough research that engendered empathy for users in the potential industry vertical we keyed in on. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Structure has done a fantastic job opening its entire API for public consumption, but which stakeholders would benefit from the unique capabilities outlined in its feature list? Furthermore, which direction would be the most beneficial for Occipital to continue their own development?

  <div class="slug article__nutshell">
  <strong>In a nutshell:</strong>
  <span class="h1-spaced">
    Systematic instruction on iterative design, prototyping, wireframing, user interviewing, usability testing,
    and front end development topics, including accessibility, performance budgeting and atomic architecture

  <p>
    The plan of attack was to first catalog potential touch points across the platform and identify potential user's pain points. Our research had given us a broad view of industries that may benefit from 3D technology. However, my team recognized that this was a distant and impersonal view without the feedback from real users and stakeholders. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Staring at a computer screen only gets you so far - I couldn't proceed until I talked to people. 
  </p>
  <h3 class="txt-h3">So, what did I actually do?</h3>
  <p>
    My team interviewed doctors, medical students, several developers, an entrepreneurial biomedical engineer, a scenic carpenter and a construction foreman. We even pounded the pavement to speak with dressmakers in bridal boutiques. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, armed with insight into the day-to-day lives of potential user, my team began to assemble their need states and map them to Occipital's value proposition.  
  </p>
  <p>
    I miscalculated my next steps. My team and I had been ideating and diverging for almost two weeks. Naturally, I thought the next step should be to converge. The real breakthrough happened when we recognized the need to diverge even more and to trust the process.

  <h2 class="txt-h2">What did you do?</h2>
  <!-- dude, where's my h3?-->
  <p>
    After mind-mapping potential use cases from the most promising industries, my team identified patterns in both user need states as well as the most prominent hooks to Occipital's platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    When my team finally converged, we had an ideal candidate in mind for Occipital's product, a key
    set of features they would be interested in, and an action plan to both engage that user group as well 
    as illicit feedback from that group at regular intervals
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="txt-h2">What's are the Takeaways?</h2>
  <h3 tagline>Researching:</h3>
  <p>
    Targeted, efficient research includes acknowledging when a potential vertical doesn't represent an appropriate group to target 
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, during a mind-mapping session, the team discovered a potential use case for shoppers to scan their feet and use the generated model to purchase the perfect pair of shoes. However, this represented neither high-level of use of the system nor ease of implementation on the vendor side of this equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, industries such as healthcare represented a higher level of risk of adopting new technology due to regulation and privacy/ security concerns and, subsequently, didn't 
  </p>
  <h3 tagline>Interviewing</h3>
  <p>
    Managing your assumptions is a key component of interviewing 
  </p>
  <p>
    This was poignantly on display when trying to decipher how a product could fit into the context of a user's life. It was important to remember not to ask about features of technology
  </p>
  <h3 tagline>Creating a Presentation</h3>
  <p>
    Don't wait until the last second to check if you are on the right Wi-Fi to connect to Apple TV! 
  </p>
  <p>
    It's almost <em>guaranteed</em> you'll be on the wrong one, even if you've deleted the other networks a dozen times.
